# Random_dots_art
An automated generation of dots representing contemporary art by Damien Hirst. The program takes an image and extracts the 15 mostly used colors (I have manually excluded the white shades, as I was using an image with a white background). Then, the RGB color values are used to generate a 10x10 dotted image.
